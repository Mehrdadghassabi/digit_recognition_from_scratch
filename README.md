# handwritten_digit_recognition_from_scratch
in this repository i tried to solve handwritten digits recognition problem with different nueral network architecture.

- without using common NNs libraries like tensorflow or pytorch just with pure code
- mnist dataset has been used

## dumbest network
as mnist dataset pictures are 28*28 the input layer would have 784 nodes and the output layer would have 10 nodes each one correspond to a digit.

the dumbest network for such a task is fully connecting the input and the output layer without any hidden layer.
